# Improved-Artificial-Lemming-Algorithm
Implementation of the Improved Artificial Lemming Algorithm (IALA) for 3D UAV path planning, addressing ALA's slow convergence and local optima.  Includes MATLAB/C++ code for IALA, ALA, WOA, etc.,plus CEC2017 benchmarks. Experiments confirm IALA's superior convergence, accuracy, stability and practical performance in complex 3D UAV path planning.
